## Current Implementation Focus (005 - GUI Component Tests)

We're currently implementing comprehensive tests for GUI components with significant progress:

- ✅ OverlayInfo component tests (100% coverage)
- ✅ OverlayMap component tests (100% coverage)
- 🔄 Dialog component tests (47% coverage)
- 🔄 View Sphere framework tests (syntax fixed, implementation ongoing)

## Planned Implementation Documents

The following implementation plans will be created as the project progresses:
- **006 - Network Component Tests**: Implementation plan for testing the network components
- **007 - Integration Tests**: Implementation plan for testing component interactions
- **008 - Functional Tests**: Implementation plan for testing complete workflows
- **009 - Performance Tests**: Implementation plan for testing performance
- **010 - CI/CD Setup**: Implementation plan for setting up continuous integration and deployment
- **011 - Code Refactoring**: Implementation plan for refactoring the codebase
- **012 - MCTS Implementation**: Implementation plan for the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm
- **013 - Position Evaluation Heuristics**: Implementation plan for improving position evaluation
- **014 - Opening Book**: Implementation plan for creating an opening book
- **015 - Endgame Solver**: Implementation plan for implementing an endgame solver

## Implementation Approach

Each implementation plan follows this general structure:

1. **Goals**: The specific objectives of the implementation
2. **Implementation Steps**: Detailed steps for implementing the improvements
3. **Code Examples**: Specific code examples to guide the implementation
4. **Verification**: How to verify that the implementation is working correctly
5. **Next Steps**: What follows after completing the implementation

## Usage

To use these implementation plans:

1. Start with the first plan in the current phase
2. Follow the steps in order
3. Use the code examples as a guide but adapt them to the specific needs of the project
4. Verify that each step is working correctly before moving on to the next
5. Once all steps are complete, move on to the next implementation plan

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to these implementation plans:

1. Review the existing plans to understand the approach
2. Create a new plan following the same structure
3. Ensure that your plan is consistent with the overall roadmap
4. Submit a pull request with your changes
