## Revised Implementation Plan

The revised plan prioritizes the components with the lowest coverage while still maintaining the original structure:

#### 1.1 Dialog Tests
- Create a test harness for dialog components that doesn't require user interaction
- Test dialog initialization with various parameters
- Test dialog field validation
- Test dialog response to different input patterns
- Test dialog callback functions

Example test cases:
```python
def test_network_game_dialog_initialization():
    dialog = NetworkGameDialog(None)
    assert dialog.windowTitle() == "Network Game"
    assert dialog.server_edit.text() == "localhost:5000"

def test_dialog_field_validation():
    dialog = NetworkGameDialog(None)
    dialog.server_edit.setText("")

    assert dialog.error_label.text() != ""  # Error message should be displayed
```

#### 1.2 View Sphere Tests
- Test rendering initialization
- Test camera positioning and controls

    assert view.rotation == [0, 0]
    assert view.distance == 5.0

def test_stone_rendering():
    view = ActiveSphereView(None)
    mock_board = MagicMock()
    mock_board.board = {0: BLACK, 1: WHITE}
    view.board = mock_board
    # Test that the stones are rendered correctly
    stone_positions = view.get_stone_positions()
    assert 0 in stone_positions
    assert 1 in stone_positions
```

    assert "Black: 5" in overlay.score_label.text()
    assert "White: 3" in overlay.score_label.text()

def test_overlay_map_interaction():
    overlay = OverlayMap(None)
    # Test map clicking behavior
    with patch.object(overlay, 'on_click') as mock_on_click:
        # Simulate clicking on the map
        event = QMouseEvent(QEvent.MouseButtonPress, QPointF(10, 10),
                            Qt.LeftButton, Qt.LeftButton, Qt.NoModifier)

    with patch.object(storage, 'games') as mock_games:
        mock_games.__getitem__.side_effect = KeyError
        # Test that the code handles the KeyError gracefully
        with pytest.raises(Exception) as e:
            storage.get_key("test_room", "black")
        assert "not found" in str(e.value)

def test_storage_data_integrity():

    controller.add_player(WHITE, kind=AI)
    controller.start()
    # Play some moves
    controller.play(0)
    controller.play(1)

    # Benchmark AI move generation
    def ai_move():
        board.genmove(BLACK)
    # Run the benchmark
    result = benchmark(ai_move)
    # Assert reasonable performance
    assert result.stats.mean < 0.5  # Less than 500ms per move
```

### 6. CI/CD Enhancements (1 week) [Priority Maintained]

#### 6.1 Coverage Enforcement
- Set up minimum coverage requirements for critical components
- Configure coverage reports for pull requests
- Implement automated coverage trend analysis

## Timeline (Revised)

| Week | Tasks | Focus |
|------|-------|-------|
| 1-3 | GUI Component Tests | Dialogs, View Sphere, Overlays |
| 4-5 | Core Game Logic Tests | Board Edge Cases, Storage, Controller |
| 6-7 | Integration Tests | Client-Server, UI-Logic |
| 8 | Functional Tests | Complete Game Scenarios |
| 9 | Performance Tests | AI Benchmarks |
| 10 | CI/CD Enhancements | Coverage Enforcement |

## Success Criteria (Revised)

- Overall test coverage increase from 61% to at least 80%
- Critical components (GUI elements) coverage increased to at least 70%
- All integration test coverage increased to at least 80%
- Functional tests covering all main user workflows
- Performance benchmarks established for all critical operations
- CI/CD pipeline enforcing minimum coverage standards

## Key Changes from Original Plan

1. **Increased focus on GUI testing**: Allocating more time and priority to the components with the lowest coverage
2. **More detailed test cases**: Providing more specific test scenarios for complex components
3. **Coverage-driven priorities**: Reorganizing the plan to address the most critical gaps first
4. **Specific success metrics**: Setting clear, measurable targets for coverage improvements
5. **Timeline adjustment**: Allocating more time to GUI testing (3 weeks instead of 1 week)

This revised plan maintains the overall structure and timeline of the original plan while adjusting priorities to address the identified coverage gaps more effectively.
