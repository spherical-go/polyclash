## Implementation Approach

Each phase will follow this implementation approach:

1. **Planning**: Detailed planning of tasks, dependencies, and milestones
2. **Development**: Implementation of planned features and improvements
3. **Testing**: Thorough testing of new functionality
4. **Review**: Code review and quality assurance
5. **Documentation**: Updating documentation to reflect changes
6. **Release**: Releasing the changes to users

## Progress Tracking

Progress will be tracked using:
- GitHub Issues for individual tasks
- GitHub Projects for phase management
- Milestones for tracking phase completion
- Pull Requests for code review and integration

## Priority Adjustments

This roadmap is a living document and priorities may be adjusted based on:
- User feedback
