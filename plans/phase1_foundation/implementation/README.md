## Implementation Approach

Each implementation plan follows this general structure:

1. **Goals**: The specific objectives of the implementation
2. **Implementation Steps**: Detailed steps for implementing the improvements
3. **Code Examples**: Specific code examples to guide the implementation
4. **Verification**: How to verify that the implementation is working correctly
5. **Next Steps**: What follows after completing the implementation

## Usage

To use these implementation plans:

1. Start with the first plan in the current phase
2. Follow the steps in order
3. Use the code examples as a guide, but adapt them to the specific needs of the project
4. Verify that each step is working correctly before moving on to the next
5. Once all steps are complete, move on to the next implementation plan

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to these implementation plans:

1. Review the existing plans to understand the approach
2. Create a new plan following the same structure
3. Ensure that your plan is consistent with the overall roadmap
4. Submit a pull request with your changes
